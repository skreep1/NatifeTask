# Technologies
To develop the application, I used the following technologies:
- Swift
- UIKit and Autolayout
- URLSession for connect to api
- MVVM Architecture

# Features
I implemented the following features for the application:
- The main screen that displays the entire list of posts
and Detail screen

- Added three filter for posts:
1. Filter none (standart filter)
2. Filter rating (the filter shows the rating of the post feed)
3. Filter date ( the filter shows by the date the feed was added)
